HOTFIX 2.2.2 (AKA The Vita Update):

    This hotfix is only available for the Vita port
    Just changes some things to make it work nicely on the Vita (analog stick support, remove PC specific settings, etc.)

HOTFIX 2.2.1 (I'm hoping this is the last update):

    You no longer have the gun after leaving the house even if you didn't grab it
    Lowered exterior scene brightness on web

UPDATE 2.2 (Yep, there were MORE bugs):

    You can return to the main menu at any time
    Fixed version string
    Debug Menu text only appears when you are in debug mode
    Fixed step ordering when you leave without a gun
